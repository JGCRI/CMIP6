In order to downlaod files from ETHZ you will need to concact Urs Beyerle, IAC/ETHZ to for a read me 
that has the information to use Rsync commands to download data from them. You will also need to be 
set up with an account on pic's data transfer node. In order to download the files you will have 
to do some work on the data transfer node and on constance. 

1. On the data transfer node you will need to run the Rsync command that make a list of information 
about all of the files stored on the ETHZ computers as a txt file. This txt file will contain 
information about the file, the path on ETHZ, and check sum information. 

2. Modify and run the format_filelistTEMPLATE.R script, this R script processes the file list txt file 
to include files that do not already live on pic and can be subset for your choice of data and returns 
a txt file that can be run with an Rsync command to download specific CMIP6 data. 

3. Run a bash script on a dtn2 detached screen that looks something like... 

	##!/bin/bash/
	#
	## Make the to_download.txt file into an argument as a possible enhancment
	## THE RSYNC COMMAND TO DOWNLOAD FILES LISTED IN to_download.txt
	#
	# echo "Moving downloaded netcdfs to ./to_move"
	## Move all of the files from the cmip6 directory to the to_move direcotry
	# find ./cmip6/ -type f -exec mv --backup=numbered -t ./to_move {} +
	#
	## As a means of quilaity controls before transfering to the CMIP6 archive check to make sure that the netcdf is not
	## empty.
	# echo "Netdcf quiality control"
	# find ./to_move -empty -type f -delete
	# find ./to_move -name '*.nc.~*~' -delete
	# rm -r ./cmip6
	#
	# echo "files to archive " ls ./to_move -1 | wc -l
	#	
	# echo "done."

  
4. Then you will need to move the files from the data transfernode to the CMIP6/archive. To do this 
log onto constance and nativage to the /pic/dtn2/usrNNN/ and run use the following linux 
commands to move the netcdf files from the nested dir strucutre. 
  find ./cmip6/ -type f -exec mv --backup=numbered -t . {} +
Then move the files to the relevant folders in the pic archive. 

Helpful hint to check to see if all the netcdf files have been moved out of the sub dir run the following command. 
  find ./cmip6/ -name "*.nc" -printf '.' | wc -l

5. RERUN THE INDEX SCRIPT! It is extreemly important that the index stays up to date.
